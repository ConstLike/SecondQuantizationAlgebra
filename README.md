# Second Quantization Algebra (SQA) Package

## Overview

The working equations of the full-internally contracted multireference configuration interaction (FIC-MRCI) were derived with the modified SQA program using spin-free unitary group generators. The code generator handles tensor contractions that cannot be coded manually. This feature enabled FIC-MRCI implementation as a pilot code for DMRG-MRCI development (M. Saitow et al. J Chem Phys 139, 044118 (2013)). The modified SQA package supports development of electronic structure theory methods.

## Current Version

**Maintainer**: Konstantin Komarov

**Last Updated**: October 2025

**Python Version**: 3.x (migrated and optimized from Python 2.x)

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone repository
cd /path/to/SecondQuantizationAlgebra

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Or install directly
python setup.py install
```

### Quick Start

```python
import secondQuantizationAlgebra as sqa

# Create indices
i = sqa.index('i', [], True)
j = sqa.index('j', [], True)

# Create operators
cre_i = sqa.creOp(i)
des_j = sqa.desOp(j)

# Normal order
term = sqa.term(1.0, [], [des_j, cre_i])
result = sqa.normalOrder(term)
```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation with examples and API reference, see [SQA_User_Guide.md](SQA_User_Guide.md).

The User Guide covers:
- Core classes (indices, operators, tensors, terms)
- Operations (normal ordering, commutators, RDM decomposition)
- Code generation (Fortran 90, TeX output)
- Utility functions and workflows

## Testing

The package includes test suites to verify functionality:

### Run Basic Tests

```bash
python3 sqaTest.py
```

Tests 1-3 validate core operations:
- **Test 1**: Normal ordering of operator strings
- **Test 2**: Commutators with symmetry handling
- **Test 3**: Index type constraints

### Run Tensor Tests

```bash
python3 sqaTest_tensors.py
```

Validates common tensor types (h1, h2, a2, d1, d2) and symmetries.

### Run MRSF Benchmark

```bash
python3 sqaTest_mrsf.py
```

Multi-reference spin-free T11ab calculation (benchmark: 2.3 seconds, 22 terms).

## Version History

### Python 3 Migration and Performance Optimization (2025)

Python 3 migration and performance improvements:

  * **Python 3 compatibility**: Migrated from Python 2.x using 2to3 and manual fixes
  * **Performance**: 14.7x speedup over Python 2 implementation
  * **Code changes**:
    - Replaced `del()` loop operations with list comprehensions
    - Added LRU caching to frequently called functions
    - Reduced `allDifferent()` complexity from O(n^2) to O(n)
  * **Benchmark**: MRSF T11ab test executes in 2.3 s (was 33.6 s in Python 2)

### Original Modifications by M. Saitow

Distinctions from the original SQA package:

  * Use of spin-free unitary group generator is made fully functional
  * A simple code generator integrated inside SQA
